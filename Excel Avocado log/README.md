# Avocado Picking Log
For my family's farm, I created a picking log to keep track of how many avocados we pick from each tree and each variety to get a total of all avocados picked that year. To do this, I created two Excel Workbooks. One is called 'Grove Map', which has a map of each variety of avocado trees on different tabs. 

Below is an example of this with the Lamb Hass avocado variety. Each Lamb Hass tree is represented by a box highlighted in red. When picking Lamb Hass, we print this page out and write in with pen or pencil how many avocados we picked from each tree.

Once we finish picking either some or all of this variety, we can plug in the numbers to another file I created which calculates the total avocados for that variety. I named this Excel workbook 'Avocado Log Master' which gets duplicated to be used for different years. Below is an example of this for the Lamb Hass trees in 2021. Not all of the trees got picked as of this data but what is there is totaled at the bottom of the sheet.

This total of Lamb Hass avocados is included with all of the other avocado variety totals to find the cumulative total of all avocados picked that year. Once we get enough data over the years, we can find trends for how each variety is producing and maybe make some decisions from that information.
