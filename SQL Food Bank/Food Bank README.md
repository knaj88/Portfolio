# Food Bank Database
For a project in my Database Management class, I created a database of a fictional food bank. I brainstormed different aspects that a food bank would need to keep track of like Facilities, Products, Employees, and other parties and considered how they relate to each other. Using this knowledge, I created an entity-relationship diagram to visualize how they work together.

Once I had this information, I was able to use SQL to create these parties (or entities) as individual tables in a schema as shown below.

With this information in a schema, I am able to use SQL queries to pull out filtered data from one or more of the tables.
