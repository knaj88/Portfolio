# Tableau Project
For a class, I analyzed through Tableau the percentage of cat and dog owners by age and state. I pulled together two speadsheets in Tableau. I used [catsvdogs-2.xlsx](https://github.com/knaj88/Portfolio/files/8840625/catsvdogs-2.xlsx) as data for the cat and dog ownership by state from Kaggle, and [US population by State, Age, and Gender.xlsx](https://github.com/knaj88/Portfolio/files/8840630/US.population.by.State.Age.and.Gender.xlsx) for age and gender demographics by state from the Census Bureau website. 
I joined these two together in Tableau by the state column to create vizualizations.
